            <p>Hello! I'm Ken. I live in Seattle, but my original home was in Nebraska. I have a backround in the optical industry and I'm currently a lab technician. My only experience with web development are online for HTML, CSS and Js. I've also done some game development with Unity. My goal is to become a developer, and learn as much as I can so that I can create better things in the future.
